# Mini Testing Library ðŸ§ª

Welcome to the Mini Testing Library, a simple yet powerful JavaScript testing library designed for developers who want to understand the inner workings of testing libraries.

## Example Usage ðŸš€
```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from './testing-library';
import { sum } from './sum';

describe('Basic addition', () => {
    it('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
        expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
    });

    it('adds 2 + 5 to equal 7', () => {
        expect(sum(2, 5)).toBe(7);
    });
});
```

## Why building Testing Library? ðŸ¤”
> Building your own X gives you a chance to really understand how X works.
